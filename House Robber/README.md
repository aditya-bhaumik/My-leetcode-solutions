<p>You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and <b>it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.</b><p>
Given an integer array <code>nums</code> representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight <b>without alerting the police.</b>

<h2>Example 1 :</h2>
<pre>
  <b>Input :</b> nums = [1,2,3,1]
  <b>Output :</b> 4
  <b>Explanation :</b> Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
</pre>


<h2>Example 2 :</h2>
<pre>
  <b>Input :</b> nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
  <b>Output :</b> 12
  <b>Explanation :</b> Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1). 
                       Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
