<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/">Pseudo palindromic paths in a binary tree</a></h2>
Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.
